    <h1> Sports That I Like </h1>
    <h2> About Me </h2>
    <p> Hello, my name is Andreas Ramdas. I am 17 years old and I love sports. I attend Beacon High School (in Hell's Kitchen) and will be a Senior next year. I am involved in sports inside and outside of school.</p>

    <div id="fencing">

    <p> My favorite sports is Fencing. I have been fencing for seven years now. I have a D rating and I qualified for the junior olympics. I fence both inside and outside of school and I will be team captain in my senior year. I recommended everyone try fencing at least sometime in their lives because stabbing other people with consequences is amazing. If you are afraid to get hit don't worry about it. I remember when I was younger, getting hit was scary and it hurt. But overtime I got used to it, plus, the worst injury that I ever got was a bruise.</p>

    <div id="swimming">

    <p> I really enjoy swimming because I love the water. I love swimming so much, that I was named Fish Boy (by my family) because I never liked to get out of the water. I used to take swim lessons but I stopped because of an injury. However, I always love to go to the beach to bodysurf and swim in my pool. I think that if I did not have swimming as a part of my life I would not be the same person I am today.</p>

    <p> Soccer is one of the best sports that I have ever played. When I was about 9 or so I used to play in a league called The West Side Soccer League. I would play every Saturday and sometimes my father would be the referee of the game. I also love to watch the World Cup, and cheer on the Brazil and Argentina teams (because I am part Brazilian and part Argentine). I eventually stopped playing soccer because I had to choose between "majoring" in Fencing, Football or Soccer.</p>

    <div id="football">

    <p> I used to play Flag Football when I was in elementary school. I used to play against my friends and we would always be very competitive with each other. Eventually as I got older the rules of the league that I played in changed and they told me that I could only play tackle football because of my age. I found it very disturbing so I quit flag football, and now just watch the Superbowl.
